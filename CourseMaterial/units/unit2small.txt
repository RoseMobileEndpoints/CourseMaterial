2 $#$ More than that.
3 $#$ More than that.
4 $#$ $#$ yes
5 $#$ Not that many.

Q: What type of layout does the main menu use?
TYPE: MC
RelativeLayout $#$ That would work, but it can be done more simply using another one.
LinearLayout $#$ $#$ yes
FrameLayout $#$ That would be painful since you'd have to position each button and text view using gravity.
AbsoluteLayout $#$ $#$ That type of layout, in which positions are specified in pixels, is deprecated (scheduled to be phased out in a future release).
