ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What are some features from PasswordKeeper that we have already used in this class?
TYPE: MS
Fragments with callbacks to communicate with other parts of the app. $#$ yes

Q: What are some features from PasswordKeeper that we haven't covered but you can learn from this app?
TYPE: MS
Fragments with callbacks to communicate with other parts of the app. 
Expandable, animated RecyclerView entries $#$ yes
Firebase ChildEventListeners $#$ 
IME keyboard options $#$ yes
Maps and location services $#$
RecyclerView with swipe-to-delete $#$  

Q: In which class will we be writing all of our authentication code?
TYPE: MC
LoginFragment $#$ Despite the name, that's not where the logic is.
PasswordFragment $#$ Remember the passwords stored are for other services, not the passwords we are are using to sign in to our app. 
MainActivity $#$ This is the class that implements the interface callbacks $#$ yes

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What are the three types of rules?
TYPE: MS
.logic $#$
.login $#$
.read $#$ yes
.validate $#$ yes
.write $#$ yes

Q: What is the $ used for in a rule?
TYPE: MC
It designates an object $#$ 
It denotes that the designated object is used to store currency $#$ 
It is a wildcard $#$ $#$ yes

Q: What variable is used to store login data for a user such as their user ID?
TYPE: MC
auth $#$ $#$ yes
login $#$ Although it is used in conjunction with login.
$auth $#$ $ is for user-defined variables, not built-in ones.
$login $#$ $ is for user-defined variables, not built-in ones.
 
Q: Which one of these is _not_ an advantage of Bolt? 
TYPE: MC
Simpler format $#$ That's the main advantage.
The ability to define types so it generate validation rules $#$ That's a huge advantage of bolt. Once you have model objects, you can determine the types easily.
Bolt is more expressive; that is, you can define rules in Bolt that can't be defined in json $#$ Bolt is compiled into json, so it can only do what json can do. $#$ yes
