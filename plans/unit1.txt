ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: When you create new projects in this unit, what type of Activity do you select? 
TYPE: MC
No activity $#$ There was something.
Empty Activity $#$ That is the most basic one and we'll use it in this unit. Later you will use others. $#$ yes
Blank Activity $#$ That will be for the next unit, when we need menus.
Navigation Drawer Activity $#$ We'll use that later this term. Of course, you are free to play around with Nav Drawers or others now if you like. 

Q: What naming convention is used for packages?
TYPE: MC
just use your initials $#$ That isn't descriptive enough
use findViewById $#$ We will learn about that in an upcoming video.
reverse URL $#$ By choosing a company name of yourusername.rosehulman.edu, your package will be edu.rosehulman.yourusername.theappname $#$ yes

Q: What can you find in the AndroidManifest.xml file? Look at the file if you aren't sure.
TYPE: MS
The package name $#$ yes 
The Activity that will be launched $#$ yes
What versions of Android your app is written for $#$

Q: In which values file does our screen text go?
TYPE: MC
colors.xml $#$ Next lesson, we'll learn about specifying RGB colors
dimens.xml $#$ That's for margins and other dimensions you need to be re-used.

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is the main reason we place our strings in the strings.xml values file?
TYPE: MC
We like doing more work $#$ But we admit that may be true for you.
Android complains if we use hardcoded strings $#$ That isn't the main reason, although that is true.
It makes it easier to maintain the strings $#$ Especially if we want to do localization (swap languages) later. $#$ yes

RGB can each be 1 digit $#$ yes 
RGB can each be 2 digits $#$ yes
Alpha (transparency) is optional $#$ yes
They must start with # $#$ yes
They can use decimal instead of hex $#$

Q: If you want a view to stretch across the screen, what value should you use for android:layout_width?
TYPE: MC
matchParent $#$ $#$ yes
fillParent $#$ That is what it used to be called. (And it will work fine if you use it, so you still get full credit.)
wrapContent $#$ That will only be as large as the text within it.

Q: When it is important to give an ID to a widget in the layout?
TYPE: MS
To refer to it in code $#$ $#$ yes
Every widget needs an ID $#$

<ul>
<li>This lesson teaches you how to use button's onClickListeners, and you'll learn how to capture views from the layout, and strings and colors from your resource files.</li>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: How do you refer to a string in code?
TYPE: MC
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.somename) $#$
getString(R.string.somename) $#$ $#$ yes
getResources().getQuantityString(R.plurals.somename, how_many) $#$ Only if you need cases based on plurals.
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$ 

Q: How do you refer to plurals in code?
TYPE: MC
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.somename) $#$
getString(R.string.somename) $#$ Only if you wanted to handle the different cases without Android support
getResources().getQuantityString(R.plurals.somename, how_many) $#$ $#$ yes
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$ 

Q: How do you refer to a color in code?
TYPE: MC
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.somename) $#$ $#$ yes
getString(R.string.somename) $#$
getResources().getQuantityString(R.plurals.somename, how_many) $#$
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$

Q: How do you refer to (capture) a view in code?
TYPE: MC
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.somename) $#$ 
getString(R.string.somename) $#$
getResources().getQuantityString(R.plurals.somename, how_many) $#$
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$ $#$ yes

Q: You use findViewById to get a Button. However, that method returns a View, so what else do you need to do to assign it to a Button?
TYPE: MC
Nothing, just assign to a Button $#$ They are different types, so it won't compile.
Pass the View returned by findViewById to the Button constructor $#$
Typecast it $#$ For example, Button b = (Button)findViewById(R.id.someid); $#$ yes

Q: What method is used to add a listener to a Button?
TYPE: MC
addListener() $#$ Right idea, though. What kind of listener? There are several.
addActionListener() $#$ That is from the Swing library in Java.
setOnClickListener() $#$ $#$ yes

LESSON TITLE: MVC and Tic Tac Toe Model
LESSON VIDEO: MVCAndTicTacToeModel/MVCAndTicTacToeModel_player.html
YOUTUBE ID: R33mXKGkdYc
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>This lesson is about the Model-View-Controller design pattern and how Android supports it. We look briefly at a model for a TicTacToe game.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Consider the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By using xml layouts, you are separating which two?
TYPE: MC
M&V $#$ The xml is the view, but it is our responsibility to separate out the model from the controller if needed.
M&C $#$ That is our job.
V&C $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Which two tend to get put together in simple apps?
TYPE: MC
M&V $#$ The view is separated by using xml layouts.
M&C $#$ Consider HelloButton: the only thing that would go in the model is the click count. $#$ yes
V&C $#$ These are separated by using xml layouts.

Q: Which TicTacToeGame model method should you call to get the game state string?
TYPE: MC
stringForGameState() $#$ $#$ yes
ticTacToeState() $#$ Look back at the given code.
getGameStateString() $#$ That does sound reasonable, but look back at the given code.

Q: Which model method should you call when a button is pressed?
TYPE: MC
setOnClickListener() $#$ Later we will use that to listen to button clicks.
buttonPressedForModel() $#$ Good guess. But don't guess. Look at the code.
pressedButtonAtLocation() $#$ $#$ yes

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What value do we use for the stretchColumns property to cause all columns in the table to stretch?
TYPE: MC
* $#$ That is a wildcard. $#$ yes
? $#$ That is sometimes used as a wildcard character, but not here.
all

Q: What color is Rose-Hulman red?
TYPE: MC
#FFFFFF $#$ That is white.
#000080 $#$ Since the third hex pair has the largest numerical value, that would be blue - see colorpicker.com to see what shade if you are curious.
#800000 $#$ Good memory. Want a job in Communications? $#$ yes

Q: What method would we use to align the bottom edge of a button with the bottom of the RelativeLayout it is part of? If you aren't sure, type it in the xml editor and read the documentation that pops up.
TYPE: MC
android:layout_alignBaseline $#$ But that is a valid xml property.
android:layout_alignBottom $#$ That aligns the bottom of two sibling views.
android:layout_alignParentBottom $#$ Since the layout contains the button, it is the parent of the button. $#$ yes

Q: To specify the position of view A relative to view B, what must be true? 
TYPE: MS
view A must have an ID $#$  
view B must have an ID $#$ yes
view A must be declared before view B in the xml $#$  
view B must be declared before view A in the xml $#$ yes

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to respond when listing to multiple buttons.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: To make it easier later on to distinguish which button was pressed, how do we store the 9 buttons in code?
TYPE: MC
as an array $#$ That is possible, but you would need to convert from a (row,column) pair to an index.
as a 2d array $#$ Tables work well as 2d arrays. $#$ yes
as 9 separate variables $#$ That would work but is cumbersome.

Q: Which class responded to the button clicks?
TYPE: MC
Each button $#$ You would need to override the Button class to do that, since Buttons are not OnClickListeners.
An anonymous listener for each button $#$ That could work, but it is not what we did.
MainActivity $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Because of that choice, onClick must use getId() to distinguish between how many buttons?
TYPE: MC
1 $#$ That was only the new game button.
9 $#$ You forgot the new game button!
10 $#$ 9 tic tac toe buttons plus the new game button. $#$ yes

Q: What neat method did we use to programmatically generate IDs for each button?
TYPE: MC
getIdentifier() $#$ $#$ yes
getId() $#$ It can also create other identifiers that aren't IDs $#$
findViewById() $#$ That refers to IDs that already exist in the layout that has been inflated. $#$

Q: How do we get debug output to the logs in our IDE?
TYPE: MC
System.out.println() $#$ That's Java. $#$
Log.d() $#$ $#$ yes
console.log() $#$ That's Javascript.

Q: What did we use for the first parameter of the Log.d() method?
TYPE: MC
The message, 'Button pressed for ' + row + ' ' + column $#$ That was the second parameter $#$
The tag, Constants.TTT $#$ Close. I do create log tag variables like this in larger programs. $#$
The tag, 'TTT' $#$ Yes, although creating a constant like Constants.TAG which equals 'TTT' would scale better. $#$ yes
