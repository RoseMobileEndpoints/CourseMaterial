<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll see the development of a simple app that one could create "out of the box" with no experience in Android. Don't worry if you don't absorb every detail. I just want to warm you up so that we can start off strong in the next unit.</li>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Which UI element was NOT used in the demo app?
TYPE: MC
Button $#$ There were two buttons.
TextView $#$ The message -I drank 4 cups- was displayed in a TextView.
Slider $#$ $#$ yes
ImageView $#$ That is how the photo of the coffee cups was displayed.

Q: Where in the app did we set an OnClickListener to respond to Button presses?
TYPE: MC
activity_main.xml $#$ That was for the layout.
MainActivity.java $#$ $#$ yes
AndroidManifest.xml $#$ We have not used that file yet. 

Q: How can you change the TextSize (font size in a TextView)? (There is more than one correct answer, so try different ones - there is no panelty for taking a question multiple times.)
TYPE: MC
Edit the raw .xml $#$ Experienced developers often do that. But it is not the only way. $#$ yes
Change the properties in the GUI editor $#$ That is what I did in the video. Very convenient especially when you are looking for a certain property. $#$ yes
Capture the TextView using findViewByID and then call .setTextSize() $#$ I used the GUI editor, but you can do it in code. $#$ yes 
Change the AndroidManifest file $#$ We haven't used that file yet. Any of the other options work, though.
