<ul>
<li>In this lesson, we'll take a brief intermission from making apps to talk about data that goes into the Firebase Database.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Can a Key be at the bottom (a leaf) of the Firebase database JSON tree? 
TYPE: MC
Sure. Just delete the value below it and the Key will exist at the bottom of the tree 
No.  If you delete the value for a key, the key is cleaned up (deleted) by Firebase automatically $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Can a Key point to multiple primitive values in the tree?  i.e. can it point to two or more Strings?
TYPE: MC
No. If a Key points to a primitive value then it does nothing else. $#$ $#$ yes
Sure. It's a tree that can have multiple branches. $#$ 

Q: Can a Key point to multiple Keys in the tree?  i.e. can it point to two or more Keys?
TYPE: MC
No. If a Key points to a Key then it does nothing else.
Sure. It's a tree that can have multiple branches (so long as those branches are other keys) $#$ $#$ yes

Q: One pattern that you see in Firebase databases is a very flat structure to the data that developers design.  Why?
TYPE: MC
No reason. Just the convention that a lot of developers use.
Data snapshots give you the key and everything below it. So you try not to nest data to keep things efficient. It's easy to make a query to get more data only when that extra data is needed. $#$ $#$ yes

YOUTUBE ID: Fem_Bb5Ie6s
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll create a Firebase account and do some setup for the backend of the MovieQuotes app we'll write. This will include importing some starting quotes and setting up rules to access the data. You'll also use the Firebase console to manipulate the data.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Did you successfully create the MovieQuotes backend?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Excellent - good start. $#$ yes
No $#$ You'll need to do this to get credit for the codealong app.

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Did you successfully install the web app?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Excellent - I think you'll enjoy using it. $#$ yes
No $#$ That's OK, you can use the console for testing. $#$ yes

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What one thing do you *not* need to do to start using Firebase in your Android client?
TYPE: MC
Add a dependency to your gradle file $#$ 
Add google play services to the gradle file $#$ 
Add internet permission to the manifest $#$
Add Firebase.setFirebaseURL(url) $#$ You essentially do this when you construct a Firebase, though. $#$ yes
END




LESSON TITLE: Pushing to Firebase
LESSON VIDEO: PushingToFirebase/PushingToFirebase_player.html
YOUTUBE ID: fyAGLbUWr58
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you will learn about Firebase's JSON data model and how to push data to Firebase.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What does JSON stand for?
TYPE: MC
An educational non-profit organization encouraging K-12 students to pursue STEM careers. $#$ That's JASON. 
JavaScript Object Notation $#$ $#$ yes
JavaScript On Netbeans $#$ Although that happens to be what you get if Google completes the phrase 'JavaScript on n...'
 
Q: Which annotation put before the key field will tell GSON to ignore the key stored in our model?
TYPE: MC
@Exclude $#$ $#$ yes
@GsonIgnoreKey $#$ Good guess.
@IgnoreField $#$
@SerializedName('ignore') $#$ You can use @SerializedName to map Android Java field names to firebase JSON field names if they differ. We didn't need to since we chose the same names for our fields.
 
Q: What does push() do?
TYPE: MS
Creates a new key $#$ yes 
Returns a Firebase reference to that key $#$ yes
Adds a new item to the Firebase stack $#$  
 
Q: What type parameter does setValue() take?
TYPE: MC
A HashMap $#$ It can, but that's not what we used, because another way is more convenient.
A MovieQuote model object $#$ Good. GSON then serializes the object into json. $#$ yes
Object $#$ It can, but would need to be typecast to a map. See the first response. 
END



LESSON TITLE: Firebase EventListeners
LESSON VIDEO: EventListeners/EventListeners_player.html
YOUTUBE ID: 8Zz5Bd5VvQ8

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What methods are part of the ChildEventListener interface?
TYPE: MS
onChildAdded $#$ yes 
onChildChanged $#$ yes
onChildRemoved $#$ yes 
onChildMoved $#$ yes
onCancelled $#$ yes

Q: What are two things that every data snapshot has? 
TYPE: MS
key $#$ yes
value $#$ yes
photo $#$

Q: What info do I pass to dataSnapshot's getValue() method to cause it to deserialize the snapshot into a java object? 
TYPE: MC
The DataSnapshot.DESERIALIZE boolean flag $#$ Seems reasonable. But no.
The object's class $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Firebase has offline capabilities that keep the data synced locally even when not connected to the backend.
TYPE: MC
True $#$ $#$ yes 
False $#$ In fact, this is why we are studying Firebase even before we study SQLite, which is used for local storage 
END

LESSON TITLE: Delete
LESSON VIDEO: Delete/Delete_player.html
YOUTUBE ID: fWkZi3_XJRM
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to delete items from the Firebase and how to listen for deletions, whether made locally or from other clients. </li>

</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: We used the MovieQuote object's key twice in this lesson. Where?
TYPE: MS
To determine which child's value to remove from the Firebase $#$ yes
When one was deleted on the Firebase, to loop over the local list and see which one was deleted $#$ yes
END



LESSON TITLE: Update

<li></li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Did you notice how similar the edit and delete code was? 
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Each calls firebaseRef.child(movieQuote.getKey()) and when listening for changes, each loops through the local list to find the key of the one that has been changed $#$ yes
No $#$ Compare them now, both the changes pushed to Firebase and the listeners.
