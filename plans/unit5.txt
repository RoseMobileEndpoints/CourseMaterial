ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What are android.app.Fragments?
TYPE: MC
Little shards of glass $#$ .
Little shards of code encapsulating layout and controller $#$ But thinking of fragment as shards is appropriate, since these pieces can be re-arranged within activities. $#$ yes

Q: How does the layout xml of a fragment differ from that of an activity?
TYPE: MC
Not at all $#$ $#$ yes
They use the fragment xml tag $#$ We did see the fragment tag in the FAQ, but that was for permanently adding a fragment to an activity, not for specifying the layout of the fragment itself.

Q: How is a Fragment class typically structured differently than an Activity class? 
TYPE: MS
Fragments extend android.app.Fragment while Activities extend android.app.Activity $#$ yes 
Fragments have a more complex lifecycle, so more callback methods $#$ yes
Activities can have onClickListeners, but Fragments cannot $#$
