LESSON TITLE: SQLite Overview

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn what SQLite is, the idea of ContentValues and Cursors, and some basic SQLite commands.</li>
</ul>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is a ContentValues?
TYPE: MC
A constuct that binds a data source to an xml layout file to replicate views $#$ That is an adapter. We will learn about CursorAdapters later in this unit.
A row in a database table that corresponds to a single model object $#$ $#$ yes
A pointer to a result set returned by a query $#$ That is a Cursor.

Q: What is a Cursor?
TYPE: MC
A constuct that binds a data source to an xml layout file to replicate views $#$ That is an adapter. We will learn about CursorAdapters later in this unit.
A row in a database table that corresponds to a single model object $#$ That is a ContentValues (see previous question)
A pointer to a result set returned by a query $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Are Cursors iterable?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ That's why they have methods like moveToFirst() and moveToNext() $#$ yes
No

Q: What does CRUD stand for in computing?
TYPE: MC
A dirty or greasy substance $#$ That's the dictionary definition - our CRUD is much more useful than that!
Create/Read/Update/Delete $#$ This concept is broader than SQLite or even databases - you have implemented these operations before, say using arrays, although without persistance. $#$ yes

Q: What SQLIte method is used to implement the R in CRUD?
TYPE: MC
delete $#$ That's the D.
insert $#$ That's the C, for Create.
query $#$ Query Reads the database and returns the Cursor of results that satisfy the query condition $#$ yes
update $#$ That's the U.

LESSON TITLE: Creating the Database
LESSON VIDEO: CreatingDatabase/CreatingDatabase_player.html
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to subclass the SQLiteOpenHelper class to create your database.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What did we add to the DataAdapter in this lesson?
TYPE: MS
Adding constants for the table keys $#$ yes
Backing up the CRUD methods
Creating instances of SQLiteOpenHelper and SQLiteDatabase. $#$ yes 
Executing SQLite CREATE statements. $#$ yes

Q: How does SimpleCursorAdapter relate to other adapters we studied?
TYPE: MC
It extends BaseAdapter $#$ $#$ yes
It extends ArrayAdapter $#$ 
END



LESSON TITLE: Adding an Item
LESSON VIDEO: AddingItem/AddingItem_player.html
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to use ContentValues to add a new item to the database.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is a ContentValues?
TYPE: MC
A constuct that binds a data source to an xml layout file to replicate views $#$ That is an adapter. We will learn about CursorAdapters later in this unit.
A row in a database table that corresponds to a single model object $#$ You knew this was a review question, right? $#$ yes
A pointer to a result set returned by a query $#$ That is a Cursor.

Q: When do you assign an ID to an item inserted into the database?
TYPE: MC
When creating the ContentValues $#$ How would you know what value to use? 
After inserting the item $#$ insert() returns the value to use. $#$ yes
When you update the item $#$ It would be too late, since you need the ID to search for the item to update. 
END

LESSON TITLE: Querying for Items
LESSON VIDEO: QueryingItems/QueryingItems_player.html
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to write a query to get all items from the database.</li>
<li>You'll also learn how to create a CursorAdapter to display the info in that Cursor in a ListView.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is a database projection? 
TYPE: MC
A list of which rows from the database you are querying for $#$ That's the selection (the where clause).
A list of which columns from the database you are querying for $#$ $#$ yes

Q: How do you tell the CursorAdapter which database columns should be displayed in which text views?
TYPE: MC
The columns and TextViews are parameters to the constructor $#$ $#$ yes
There is a default ordering based on ID $#$ It gives you more flexibility than that.

Q: When we first setup the CursorAdapter, it didn't show a recently added item until the app was re-launched or rotated. What did we do to show an item that was just added?
TYPE: MC
We added the item to an ArrayList as well and called notifyDataSetChanged() on the adapter. $#$ Not a bad idea. We didn't do that here, but we could in the lab.
We requeried the database and passed the new Cursor to the adapter. $#$ $#$ yes
We didn't add that functionality.
END



LESSON TITLE: Updating an Item
LESSON VIDEO: UpdatingItem/UpdatingItem_player.html
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to update an item in the database. </li>
<li>You'll also learn how to query the database for a single item.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: To auto-populate the update dialog with an item, we needed to query for only that item. How do we do that? 
TYPE: MC
Specify a selection (where clause) with the id $#$ Aren't you glad you saved the ID in the model object when it was inserted? $#$ yes
Specify a projection (columns) with the id $#$ That just tells you which columns to return - it doesn't affect which table row(s) you get in the Cursor.

Q: What value does the database's update() method return?
TYPE: MC
Nothing. It is a void method, which is why we didn't assign a return value to a variable. $#$ Look it up.
A boolean telling whether or not it was successful.
An int telling how many rows were updated. $#$ $#$ yes
END



LESSON TITLE: Deleting an Item
LESSON VIDEO: DeletingItem/DeletingItem_player.html
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to delete an item or items from the database.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Did you appreciate how easy delete was was to do?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ It is always good to be thankful! $#$ yes
No $#$ Too bad - I thought you would.

Q: Did you notice how I kept mistyping 'whereClause' as 'whereClaude' in this unit? 
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Just muscle memory in my fingers, formed from repeatedly typing the name of my friend and colleague, Claude Anderson. :) $#$ yes
No $#$ Just muscle memory in my fingers, formed from repeatedly typing the name of my friend and colleague, Claude Anderson. :) $#$ yes
