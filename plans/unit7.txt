ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Which of these is NOT a model object within the GradeRecorder Firebase?
TYPE: MC
Owner $#$
Course $#$
Assignment $#$ 
GradeEntry $#$ 
Assistant $#$ Teaching assistants are just owners, just like the instructors. $#$ yes

Q: A single course can have multiple assignments. How is this represented in the Firebase?
TYPE: MC
There is a table that maps course keys to assignment keys; we then do a join to get all the assignments for a course $#$ Sorry, Firebase uses a no-SQL database, so there are no joins.
Each assignment stores the key of its course $#$ That allows us to write a Query for only the assignments that have that key. $#$ yes
Each course has a set of keys of its assignments $#$ Good idea, and that's what we did to relate courses and owners. But what we did here allows for simpler Firebase code.

Q: If a student in the GradeRecorder app takes multiple courses, are they represented uniquely in Firebase? 
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Unfortunately not. We make the simplifying assumption that since this is an instructor-centric app, then the students in one course are considered distinct from those in another course. So a student is only associated with a single course.
No $#$ We make the simplifying assumption that since this is an instructor-centric app, then the students in one course are considered distinct from those in another course. So a student is only associated with a single course. $#$ yes

Q: Did you successfully run GradeRecorder?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Good. Carry on! $#$ yes
No $#$ Please go back and do it, since it's the first step of this week's lab.

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: How do we tell Firebase to only listen for additions/deletions/or edits to students who are associated with a certain course?
TYPE: MS
Use a Query $#$ yes
Save the course key in the Student $#$ yes
Use a ChildEventListener on the Query $#$ yes

Q: To get the name of a course for which we have the key, we called addListenerForSingleValueEvent. What is the signficance of the word Single? If you aren't sure, read <a href='https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/api/#query_methods' target='_blank'>this</a>
TYPE: MC
It fires only once. $#$ That is the only difference between that listener and a regular ValueEventListener. $#$ yes
It only gets a single value instead of all its children like a ChildEventListener $#$ Good guess, but no. Any old ValueEventListener gets a 'single value'. Although, that single value is a path, so could contain lots of data!
There is no signficance $#$ Silly answer.

<li>In this lesson, you'll investigate the Course and Owner fragments and adapters to see an example of doubly-linked data and cascaded listeners.</li>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: A course can have several owners. How do we do this in Firebase? 
TYPE: MC
Store the owners in a List $#$ 
Store the owners in a Map $#$ Yes, each owner's key is their user ID and their value is simply 'true'. $#$ yes
Add paths for owner1, owner2, etc $#$ Actually this is pretty close. But those paths are because the owners are stored in a Map.

Q: A course has a set of owners. I want to get info about each owner to display. So I use cascaded listeners. What does this mean?
TYPE: MC
When one listener callback method is called, it causes other listeners to be added. $#$ $#$ yes
Huh? $#$ See When one listener callback method is called, it causes other listeners to be added. See 13:00 - 14:30 in the video.
