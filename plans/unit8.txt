ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions 
Q: How do you obtain a Map API Key?
TYPE: MC
Follow the Google developers console URL contained in google_maps_key.xml $#$ Definitely a nice convenience feature. $#$ yes
Extract your SHA1 fingerprint manually and enter it and your project's package name in the Google developers console $#$ That works, but it's not as convenient.
Email map_api_key_request@google.com $#$

position  $#$ yes
rotation  $#$ yes
tilt
title $#$ yes

Q: What value should be returned from onMarkerClick() if we want the title and snippet to appear when clicked?
