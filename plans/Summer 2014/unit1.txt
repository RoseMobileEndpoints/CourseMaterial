<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn about the files that are created in a vanilla Hello World project. 
You will also be introduced to 3 apps that we will write in this unit: 
Hello Button, Tic Tac Toe (both together in the videos), and LightsOut (the lab)</li>
</ul>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: When creating a new project, I would like you to add what info to the name of each project?
TYPE: MC
Nothing $#$ There was something.
Your name or initials $#$ That will help me much while grading!$#$ yes
The name of the CEO of Google $#$ Interesting, but seeing the name Larry Page on your app is not helpful to me.

Q: What naming convention is used for packages?
TYPE: MC
Always use just your initials $#$ That was for the last question.
use findViewById $#$ We will learn about that in an upcoming video.
reverse URL $#$ Please use something like edu.rosehulman.yourusername.theappname $#$ yes

Q: What can you find in the AndroidManifest.xml file? Look at the file if you aren't sure.
TYPE: MS
The package name $#$ yes 
The Activity that will be launched $#$ yes
What versions of Android your app is written for $#$ yes

LESSON TITLE: Hello Button View

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn about making UIs from a specification, including layouts and string and color resources.</li>
</ul>

END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is the main reason we place our strings in the strings.xml values file?
TYPE: MC
We like doing more work $#$ But we admit that may be true for you.
Android complains if we use hardcoded strings $#$ That isn't the main reason, although that is true.
It makes it easier to maintain the strings $#$ Especially if we want to do localization (swap languages) later. $#$ yes

Q: What is true of the format of colors in colors.xml?
TYPE: MS
RGB can each be 1 digit $#$ yes 
RGB can each be 2 digits $#$ yes
Alpha (transparency) is optional $#$ yes
They must start with # $#$ yes
They can use decimal instead of hex $#$

Q: If you want a view to stretch across the screen, what value should you use for android:layout_width?
TYPE: MC
matchParent $#$ $#$ yes
fillParent $#$ That is what it used to be called. (And it will work fine if you use it, so you still get full credit.)
wrap content $#$ That will only be as large as the text within it.

<li>This lesson teaches you how to use button's onClickListeners, and you'll learn how to grab views from the layout, and strings and colors from your resource files.</li>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: How do you refer to a string in code?
TYPE: MC
getResources().getColor(R.color.somename)
getString(R.string.somename) $#$ $#$ yes
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$ 

Q: How do you refer to a color in code?
TYPE: MC
getResources().getColor(R.color.somename) $#$ $#$ yes
getString(R.string.somename)
findViewById(R.id.somename)

Q: How do you refer to a view in code?
TYPE: MC
getResources().getColor(R.color.somename)
getString(R.string.somename) 
findViewById(R.id.somename) $#$ $#$ yes

Q: You use findViewById to get a Button. However, that method returns a View, so what else do you need to do to assign it to a Button?
TYPE: MC
Nothing, just assign to a Button $#$ They are different types, so it won't compile.
Pass the View returned by findViewById to the Button constructor $#$
Cast it $#$ For example, Button b = (Button)findViewById(R.id.someid); $#$ yes

Q: What method is used to add a listener to a Button?
TYPE: MC
addListener() $#$ Right idea, though. What kind of listener? There are several.
addActionListener() $#$ That is from the Swing library in Java.
setOnClickListener() $#$ $#$ yes

LESSON TITLE: MVC and Tic Tac Toe Model

<ul>
<li>This lesson is about the Model-View-Controller design pattern and how Android supports it. We look briefly at a model for a TicTacToe game.</li>
</ul>
CONTENT BELOW
END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Consider the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By using xml layouts, you are separating which two?
TYPE: MC
M&V $#$ The xml is the view, but it is our responsibility to separate out the model from the controller if needed.
M&C $#$ That is our job.
V&C $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Which two tend to get put together in simple apps?
TYPE: MC
M&V $#$ The view is separated by using xml layouts.
M&C $#$ Consider HelloButton: the only thing that would go in the model is the click counter. $#$ yes
V&C $#$ These are separated by using xml layouts.

Q: Which model method should you call to get the game state string?
TYPE: MC
stringForGameState() $#$ $#$ yes
ticTacToeState() $#$ Look back at the given code.
getGameStateString() $#$ That does sound reasonable, but look back at the given code..

Q: Which model method should you call when a button is pressed?
TYPE: MC
setOnClickListener() $#$ Later we will use that to listen to button clicks.
buttonPressedForModel() $#$ Good guess. But don't guess. Look at the code.
pressedButtonAtLocation() $#$ $#$ yes

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What value do we use for the stretchColumns property to cause all columns in the table to stretch?
TYPE: MC
* $#$ That is a wildcard. $#$ yes
? $#$ That is sometimes used as a wildcard character, but not here.
all

Q: What color is Rose-Hulman red?
TYPE: MC
#FFFFFF $#$ That is white.
#0939B5 $#$ Since the third hex pair has the largest numerical value, that would be blue - see colorpicker.com to see what shade if you are curious.
#B50939 $#$ Good memory. Want a job in Communications? $#$ yes

Q: What method would we use to align the bottom edge of a button with the bottom of the RelativeLayout it is part of? If you aren't sure, type it in the xml editor and read the documentation that pops up.
TYPE: MC
android:layout_alignBaseline $#$ But that is a valid xml property.
android:layout_alignBottom $#$ That aligns the bottom of two sibling views.
android:layout_alignParentBottom $#$ Since the layout contains the button, it is the parent of the button. $#$ yes

Q: To specify the position of view A relative to view B, what must be true? 
TYPE: MS
view A must have an ID $#$  
view B must have an ID $#$ yes
view A must be declared before view B in the xml $#$  
view B must be declared before view A in the xml $#$ yes

END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: To make it easier later on to distinguish which button was pressed, how do we store the 9 buttons in code?
TYPE: MC
as an array $#$ That is possible, but you would need to convert from a (row,column) pair to an index.
as a 2d array $#$ Tables work well as 2d arrays. $#$ yes
as 9 separate variables $#$ That would work but is cumbersome.

Q: Which class responded to the button clicks?
TYPE: MC
Each button $#$ You would need to override the Button class to do that, since Buttons are not OnClickListeners.
An anonymous listener for each button $#$ That could work, but it is not what we did.
MainActivity $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Because of that choice, onClick must use getId() to distinguish between how many buttons?
TYPE: MC
1 $#$ That was only the new game button.
9 $#$ You forgot the new game button!
10 $#$ 9 tic tac toe buttons plus the new game button. $#$ yes
