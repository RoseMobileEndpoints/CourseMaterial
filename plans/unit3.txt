Converts from layout files to views $#$ Inflaters do that.
Replicates views $#$ It uses a data source that could be an array or even a database or the contact list on your phone $#$ yes
Changes voltage $#$ Wrong field of study!

Q: Select every type of adapter we will study in this unit. (Hint: there are 3)
TYPE: MS
ACAdapter $#$ 
ArrayAdapter $#$ yes
BaseAdapter $#$ yes
GridAdapter $#$
RecyclerAdapte $#$ yes

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a ListView and populate it using an array and the simplest of ArrayAdapters.</li>
</ul>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Was your name used in the demo?
TYPE: MC
Yes $#$ Hope you enjoyed that. Your name was one of the most common names given to babies born in the U.S. in the year 2000 $#$ yes
No $#$ Sorry - but maybe having a unique name is better than having a popular one.  $#$ yes


Q: What method is used to tell the adapter that it needs to update?
TYPE: MC
notifyAll() $#$ That Java method is used when multithreading.
notifyDataSetChanged() $#$ $#$ yes
notifyDataSetInvalidated() 

Q: What layout did we use for a row in the ListView?
TYPE: MC
android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 $#$ $#$ yes
R.layout.simple_list_item_1 $#$ We used a built-in Android resource, so prefix it with android.

Q: Which one is these is NOT a parameter to the ArrayAdapter constructor?
TYPE: MC
Array $#$ It needs a data source.
Context $#$ It needs the context too to create views.
Layout $#$ It needs the layout of a single view.
ListView $#$ You bind the adapter to a ListView by calling setAdapter() after you construct the adapter. $#$ yes

LESSON TITLE: Extending the BaseAdapter class

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you'll learn how to override the methods in this abstract class, especially getView(). </li>
</ul>

END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Which is NOT an abstract method in BaseAdapter?
TYPE: MC
getCount() $#$ 
getItem() $#$ 
getItemId() $#$ 
getView() $#$
getContext() $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Why do we test to see if convertView is null?
TYPE: MC
Efficiency $#$ There is no need to recreate objects that have already been allocated in memory. $#$ yes
The code is cleaner and easier to maintain that way $#$ Not necessarily.
END



LESSON TITLE: Modifying a List in an Adapter
LESSON VIDEO: ModifyList/ModifyList_player.html
YOUTUBE ID: FmFImpmaJK4
CONTENT ABOVE
<ul>
<li>In this lesson, we will write methods to add and remove items from the adapter's list of model objects.</li>
</ul>

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: How do we listen to long clicks on views in a ListView?
TYPE: MC
OnItemClickListener() $#$ That isn't the one we used, but it does listen for regular clicks on ListView items 
onClickListener() $#$ That was for single clicks on single views.
onItemLongClickListener() $#$ $#$ yes
onLongClickListener() $#$ That was for single views.

Q: Which class holds the list of data managed by the adapter?
TYPE: MC
The custom BaseAdapter $#$ That is cleanest. $#$ yes
The MainActivity (where the data is displayed)  $#$ It's possible to do that, just not as clean.
The AppCompatActivity $#$ You shouldn't update the superclass.

Q: Which class actually mutates the list of data (say, by adding, removing, or editing)? 
TYPE: MC
The custom BaseAdapter $#$ That is cleanest. $#$ yes
The MainActivity (where the data is displayed)  $#$ Again, it's possible to do that, just not as clean.
The AppCompatActivity $#$ You shouldn't update the superclass.

Q: Which class holds the onItemLongClickListener()?
TYPE: MC
The custom BaseAdapter $#$ Unfortunately, no. It would be clean for each view to listen for a clicks on itself - this flaw was remedied with RecyclerAdapters.  
The MainActivity (where the data is displayed)  $#$ Unfortunately so. It would be clean for each view to listen for a clicks on itself - this flaw was remedied with RecyclerAdapters. $#$ yes
The AppCompatActivity $#$ You shouldn't update the superclass.

LESSON TITLE: RecyclerAdapter

<ul>
<li>In this lesson, you will learn how to use a RecyclerView and RecyclerAdapter</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

END

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: Which if these is NOT an advantage of using a RecyclerView over a ListView?
TYPE: MC
More efficient $#$ RecyclerViews are faster since they don't capture views as frequently.
More flexible $#$ RecyclerViews can have 3 layout managers 
Built-in support for multi-select $#$ There are 3rd party libaries that do this. $#$ yes
Built-in animations for insert/remove $#$ Yes if you do notifyItemInserted/Deleted

Q: What's the biggest structural change to the code when using a RecyclerAdapter?
TYPE: MC
ViewHolder inner class $#$ $#$ yes
notifyItemInserted/Deleted $#$ Those are nice, but are called just like notifyDataSetChanged() is called.
getCount is now getItemCount $#$ That's the smallest change!

Q: Where do we listen for long presses now? 
TYPE: MC
The RecyclerAdapter $#$ Ah, yes. $#$ yes  
The MainActivity (where the data is displayed)  $#$ Not the case for RecyclerViews like it was for ListViews
The AppCompatActivity $#$ You shouldn't update the superclass.

ACTIVITY TITLE: Questions
Q: What is the argument value of 2 do in GridLayoutManager(this, 2)
TYPE: MC
A layout with two rows $#$ The number of rows also depends on the number of items managed by the adapter.

Q: What type of view did I use to get a distinct area, with rounded corners, for each item?
TYPE: MC
CardView $#$ $#$ yes
ImageView $#$ 
RecyclerView $#$
