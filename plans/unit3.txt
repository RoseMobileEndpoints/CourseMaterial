TYPE: MC
onCreateOptionsMenu $#$ You need that to inflate the menu.
onOptionItemSelected $#$ That one is called whenever a menu item is selected - like onClick() for buttons.
onPrepareOptionsMenu $#$ $#$ yes

Q: Why do we include a title on each menu item, even if we have an icon for it?
TYPE: MS
If there is no room for the icon, the title will appear in the overflow menu $#$ yes 
If you long press the icon, the title will appear as a hint. $#$ yes

Q: What does setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled do?
TYPE: MC
It lets you specify which activity should be launched if you press the home caret in the ActionBar $#$ $#$ yes
