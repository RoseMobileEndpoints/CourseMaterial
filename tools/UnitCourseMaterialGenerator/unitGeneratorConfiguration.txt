Line 1: batch|interactive: Batch mode is faster, interactive lets you choose files and folders.
Line 2: standalone|coursebuilder: output format. Generate standalone webpages or the csv files required by CourseBuilder.   
Line 3: single|multiple: Process a single unit or multiple ones.

Line 4: If in batch mode, this gives the relative path and filename to either:
	the lesson plan file for this unit, which contains an output directory for that unit as well.
	a file containing which units should be processed, which each have output directories...
	Examples: 
		../CourseMaterial/plans/unit11.txt
		../CourseMaterial/plans/all_units.txt

Line 5: The relative path of the templates to be used to generate this unit.
